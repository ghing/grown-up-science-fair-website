This experiment by Geoff Hing used a fitness tracker to record his average resting heart rate.  He tracked his coffee consumption in a spreadsheet and used Python code to see if there was a correlation between greater coffee consumption and heightened average resting heart rate.

Flipping the script on a youth science fair, the Grown Up Science Fair was "judged" by children participating in a Chicago Park District spring break day camp.  They awarded their favorite projects with drawings like this one.
