The first Chicago Grown Up Science Fair was held on April 20, 2016 at the [Northerly Island field house](http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/northerly-island-park/).  The Facebook event for the fair is [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/900024393426613/).

## Illinois Fossils: Why different colors?

This is how the project's creator described his project:

> Midwestern fossils and rocks are not all the same color -- even the same kind of animal appears in browner shades in the middle of Illinois than at its edges, browner in the middle of Michigan than at its edges. What's going on? Learn how geologic maps help us understand the ancient environments that have shaped life and fossilization for the Midwest's animals and plants.

This experiment by Geoff Hing used a fitness tracker to record his average resting heart rate.  He tracked his coffee consumption in a spreadsheet and used Python code to see if there was a correlation between greater coffee consumption and heightened average resting heart rate.

## Judged by children

Flipping the script on a youth science fair, the Grown Up Science Fair was "judged" by children participating in a Chicago Park District spring break day camp.  They awarded their favorite projects with drawings like this one.
