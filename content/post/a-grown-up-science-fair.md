The Chicago Grown Up Science Fair is a chance for adults to use scientific methods, data and research to explore questions and solve problems as part of a supportive, fun community.  The fair is a low-pressure entry point back to scientific practice for adults whose education or work hasn’t necessarily allowed them to use science as a tool to address their curiosity.

## We’re all adults here

Most science fairs for elementary and high school students have a mountain of rules.  This one doesn’t.

You have to:

* Be an adult.
* Register your interest using [this form](/signup/).
* Document your experiment or design project in a report, article, comic, zine, website, song, performance …
* Make an awesome trifold.
* Bring it to the science fair. Date and location will be announced soon.
* No volcanos (ok, you can make a volcano, but it better be a really great example of an “explainer”, see below).

Your project can be:

* An experiment - this is the traditional science fair project you might remember from childhood. Hypothesis, scientific method, etc.
* Invention - create a prototype of an object, algorithm or process using scientific research or knowledge
* Explainer - break down a complex scientific concept in a way that’s clear, concise and easier to understand

## When should I start my project?

Now.

## When and where is the 2017 fair?

We're still in the planning stages of the 2017 fair.  We'll update this page as soon as the date and location gets finalized.
